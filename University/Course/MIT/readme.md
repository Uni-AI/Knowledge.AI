>Description
>An efficient and high-intensity bootcamp designed to teach you the fundamentals of deep learning as quickly as possible!
>MIT's introductory program on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Program concludes with a project proposal competition with feedback from staff and panel of industry sponsors. Prerequisites assume calculus (i.e. taking derivatives) and linear algebra (i.e. matrix multiplication), we'll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is helpful but not necessary. Listeners are welcome!

## Prerequsites:
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra -> Matrix Multiplication
